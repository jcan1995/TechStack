About TechStack
============
This is a React Native application that displays a list of different web technologies along with their respective descriptions. 
Users can tap on a web technology that they want to know a little about and a short description will appear under the title.

This is my third React Native application that I created by following along Stephen Grider's course on Udemy "**The Complete React Native and Redux Course**".
